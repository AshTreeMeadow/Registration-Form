# Student Registration Form 🚧

> **Status:** ⚠️ **Work in Progress (WIP)**
> This project is currently under active development. The code is incomplete and subject to frequent changes as new files and styling improvements are added.

A structured web registration form designed for collecting student data. This project serves as a foundation that is continuously being improved with better styling, additional files, and modular code.

## 📂 Project Structure

This project currently consists of the following base files:

1.  **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML5 structure of the form (Personal, Address, Account sections).
2.  **`style.css`**: Contains the initial styling rules (Layout, Card design, Basic typography).

*Note: More CSS files and assets will be added soon to improve modularity.*

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  Ensure `index.html` and `style.css` are in the **same folder**.
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## 🔮 Future Improvements (Roadmap)

Since this is an evolving project, the following updates are planned:

* [ ] **Advanced CSS:** Breaking down the stylesheet into modular files for better maintainability.
* [ ] **Form Validation:** Adding JavaScript for real-time input checking.
* [ ] **Responsive Layout:** Improving the mobile view of the form.
* [ ] **Backend Integration:** Connecting the form action to a real server.

## 📝 Notes

* **Form Action:** The form currently points to `/action_page.php` as a placeholder.
* **Incomplete Features:** Some visual elements may look basic as the CSS is currently being refactored.
