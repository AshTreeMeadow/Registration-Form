# 🎓 Student Registration Form

A clean, responsive, and styled HTML registration form designed for educational institutions. This project demonstrates a frontend user interface for collecting personal, address, and academic account details.

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains a standalone HTML page with embedded CSS. It provides a structured layout for user registration, specifically tailored for students entering university or college data (UID, Branch, Semester, etc.).

## ✨ Features

* **Clean UI/UX:** Uses a centered card layout with a "Light Blue-Grey" background and standard "Green" accent colors.
* **Categorized Data:** Fields are logically grouped using headers:
    * **Personal:** Name, DOB, Gender, Blood Group, Contacts.
    * **Address:** Full residential address details.
    * **Account:** Academic details (UID, Course, Section, Institute).
* **Input Validation:** Utilizes HTML5 input types (`date`, `email`, `number`) for basic client-side validation.
* **Responsive Design:** Max-width constraints ensure the form looks good on various screen sizes.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Built entirely with standard HTML and CSS—no frameworks required.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Internal styling for layout, typography, and hover effects.
